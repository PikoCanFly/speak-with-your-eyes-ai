### ‚û°Ô∏è [**Try the Live Demo Here!**](https://fantastic-hamster-94cff7.netlify.app/) ‚¨ÖÔ∏è

What if you could speak with your eyes? This project makes it possible. Using the power of browser-based AI, this application tracks 478 facial landmarks in real-time to translate your blinks, nods, and head turns into Morse code, allowing you to communicate without a keyboard.

## ‚ú® Features

-   üëÅÔ∏è **Speak with Your Eyes:** Translate short blinks into dots (`.`) and long blinks into dashes (`-`).
-   ü§ñ **Full Gesture Control:**
    -   **Toggle Mode:** Nod three times to enter or exit Pattern Detection Mode.
    -   **Next Letter:** Turn your head to the right to add a space.
    -   **Backspace:** Turn your head to the left to delete the last character.
    -   **Next Word:** Nod once to add a word break.
-   üåê **Real-Time Translation:** Instantly see your Morse pattern and its English translation updated with every gesture.
-   üõ†Ô∏è **Helpful UI:** Includes a toggleable face mesh for visual feedback, optional sound effects, and an interactive Morse code guide for learning.

## ü§î How It Works

The magic is in translating subtle facial movements into discrete, intentional actions.

1.  **Blink Detection:** The app monitors the `eyeBlink` blendshapes from MediaPipe. When the blink score passes a `0.5` threshold, a frame counter begins. If the eyes are closed for 2-14 frames, it's a **short blink (dot)**. If they're closed for 15+ frames, it's a **long blink (dash)**.

2.  **Nod Detection:** To avoid false positives from minor head jitters, the app uses a "sliding window" technique. It records the Y-position of the nose tip over the last 15 frames. A nod is only registered if the difference between the highest and lowest points in that window exceeds a specific movement threshold.

3.  **Turn Detection:** The app calculates the total width between the edges of the cheeks (landmarks 234 and 454). It then calculates a "turn ratio" based on the nose tip's position relative to the cheeks. When looking straight, the ratio is ~0.5. A turn is detected when the ratio goes above `0.65` or below `0.35`.

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3.  **Start a local server.** This is required to handle the ES6 JavaScript modules.
    *   **Using Python:**
        ```bash
        # For Python 3
        python -m http.server
        ```
    *   **Using VS Code:** Install the **Live Server** extension and click "Go Live" in the status bar.

4.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the address your server provides).
